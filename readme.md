# Bank Data Analysis(Customer Churn Analysis)

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn and predicting whether a customer is likely to churn using machine learning techniques. The analysis is implemented in Python, utilizing popular libraries for data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to:

1. **Analyze customer churn data.**
2. **Preprocess data using encoding and scaling techniques.**
3. **Train a predictive model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.**
4. **Visualize results to interpret insights.**

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handling categorical variables with `LabelEncoder`.
  - Scaling features using `MinMaxScaler` for normalization.

- **Modeling**:
  - Predictive modeling using `KNeighborsClassifier` from the `sklearn` library.
  
- **Visualization**:
  - Insights and trends visualized using `matplotlib`.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anurag815311/bank-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd churn-analysis

## Usage

1. **Data Loading**:
   Ensure your dataset is in the same directory or update the data path in the notebook.

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   Use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to execute the `Analysis_churn_dataset.ipynb`.

3. **Model Training**:
   The notebook guides you through training the KNN model and evaluating its performance.

4. **Visualization**:
   Generate and interpret visualizations for churn trends.
